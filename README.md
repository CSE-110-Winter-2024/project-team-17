# Team 17 - Successorator 

---

## Summary

This is a team project for CSE 110. We are designing a task list app called Successorator for our user using Android studio. The project will be on java only.

### Iteration 1

2/05
IT assignments:
US1 & 8: Mike and Mark
US2 & 4: Ismail and Alessandro
US3: Sinclair and William

### Iteration 2

2/12
Overall I1 is completed for now. We have completed US 1 and newly added 10. (6hrs). We have also done partly on US 8 and US 3, 2, 4 (around 3 hours). So a total of 9 hours of work done. Consider our work hours of 3 hours per day from mon to fri. We have a total of 15 hours per person. Multiply by 6 to have a total of 90. So our iteration 1 velocity is **0.1**. This is a bit too low and thus resulting in our need to work overtime for iteration 2. 
Iteration 2 schedules:
We continue our unfinished UI display for 2,3,4, and 8.
US 9 & 6: Mark and Mike
US 7: Ismail and Alessandro
US 5: Sinclair and William



 - [ ] Look around the project.
   - The `docs/` directory may be helpful, as Slack/Discord messages are easy to lose.
     - This is a good place to put finalized user stories, standards, guidelines, meeting notes, etc
       that you want to stick with the repository in perpetuity (e.g. after the semester ends) e.g.
       for portfolio purposes.
     - Google Docs is easier for collaboration, but eventually you might want to put the
       finalized versions here for reference. (This way you can also reference them in PRs!)
 - [ ] Modify the `.github/pull_request_template.md` to suit your needs.
   - You **do not** need to use the exact same template, but justify your changes when you 
     PR the updated template.
 - [ ] Replace this README with something appropriate.
   - **When you do, replace the title to replace X with your team number.**
