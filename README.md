### MS1 - Iteration 1

2/05 \
Iteration 1 assignments: \
US1 & 8: Mike and Mark \
US2 & 4: Ismail and Alessandro \
US3: Sinclair and William \

### MS1 - Iteration 2

2/12
Overall, Iteration 1 has reached its interim conclusion. We've successfully tackled US 1 along with the newly introduced US 10, investing a combined 6 hours. Additionally, progress has been made on US 8, as well as US 3, 2, and 4, amounting to approximately 3 hours of effort. In total, we've dedicated 9 hours to these tasks.

Considering our standard work schedule of 3 hours per day from Monday to Friday, each team member has contributed 15 hours in this iteration. When multiplied by our team size of 6, this brings our cumulative effort to 90 hours. Consequently, our Iteration 1 velocity stands at 0.1. While this velocity falls below our target, it underscores the necessity for overtime as we move into Iteration 2.

Iteration 2 assignments: \
We continue our unfinished UI display for 2,3,4, and 8. \
US 9 & 6: Mark and Mike \
US 7: Ismail and Alessandro \
US 5: Sinclair and William \

### MS2 - Iteration 1

2/27 - 3/05 \
Iteration 1 assignments: \
US6 & 7: Mike and Mark \
US1: Ismail and Alessandro \
US2: Sinclair and William \

### MS2 - Iteration 2

3/05 - 3/14 \
Overall, Iteration 1 has reached its conclusion. We've successfully tackled US 7 and 1, investing over 18 hours of dedicated work. Considering our standard workload of 3 hours per day from Monday to Friday, each team member contributed a total of 15 hours. When multiplied by our team size of 6, this brings us to a cumulative effort of 90 hours. Consequently, our Iteration 1 velocity stands at 0.2. While this velocity is slightly lower than anticipated, it has necessitated the need for overtime as we transition into Iteration 2.

Additionally, due to time constraints and the lower priority assigned by the customer, US3 has been removed from our scope.

Iteration 2 assignments: \
We continue our unfinished UI display for 2, 3, 4, and 8. \
