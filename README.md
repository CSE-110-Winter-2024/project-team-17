### Iteration 1

2/05
IT assignments:
US1 & 8: Mike and Mark
US2 & 4: Ismail and Alessandro
US3: Sinclair and William

### Iteration 2

2/12
Overall I1 is completed for now. We have completed US 1 and newly added 10. (6hrs). We have also done partly on US 8 and US 3, 2, 4 (around 3 hours). So a total of 9 hours of work done. Consider our work hours of 3 hours per day from mon to fri. We have a total of 15 hours per person. Multiply by 6 to have a total of 90. So our iteration 1 velocity is **0.1**. This is a bit too low and thus resulting in our need to work overtime for iteration 2.
Iteration 2 schedules:
We continue our unfinished UI display for 2,3,4, and 8.
US 9 & 6: Mark and Mike
US 7: Ismail and Alessandro
US 5: Sinclair and William
